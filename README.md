# Simple C Compiler 

COEN 175 - Compilers

Santa Clara University 

Winter 2017


### Description

This repo contains all six phases to develop a compiler to compile a subset of the C
language, called Simple C. All code is written in C++. The final phase of the project writes assembly
code to be run on x86 Linux machines. 

Most of the phases have assignment PDFs describing the stage of development. All phases build
on top of the previous work. The final phase performs semantic and type checking, storage allocation, 
and writes assembly language code to be run on the local machine. Each phase of the compiler 
has a set of example code and output to test the compiler against.
